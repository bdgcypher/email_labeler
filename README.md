## email-labeler

This is a web app created to upload and label examples for datasets to train our active learning models for Branch LLC.

## Uploaing datasets

Go to the [Labeler App](https://notifai.netlify.app/) and create an account. From the dashboard click the 'Upload Dataset' button.
Follow the steps to upload your dataset. For now it is limited to email data in the .mbox format...

## Labeling

To begin labeling a dataset click on it from the list on your user dashboard. If the dataset is still processing or has failed you will have to wait a bit.
If the dataset was processed successfully you will be rerouted to the labeler. You will be greeted by a progress indicator and a card with one of your dataset examples. 
You can swipe right or left (yes or no) to indicate your response to the prompt given for the current example. Once finished labeling all the examples in your dataset you will be automatically rerouted to the User Dashboard.
